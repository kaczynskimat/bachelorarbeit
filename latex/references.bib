abstract = {Consider a data holder, such as a hospital or a bank, that has a privately held collection of person-specific, field structured data. Suppose the data holder wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k- anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, µ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.},

abstract = {The problem of privacy-preserving data analysis has a long history spanning multiple disciplines. As electronic data about individuals becomes increasingly detailed, and as technology enables ever more powerful collection and curation of these data, the need increases for a robust, meaningful, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy, together with a computationally rich class of algorithms that satisfy this definition. Differential Privacy is such a definition.After motivating and discussing the meaning of differential privacy, the preponderance of this monograph is devoted to fundamental techniques for achieving differential privacy, and application of these techniques in creative combinations, using the query-release problem as an ongoing example. A key point is that, by rethinking the computational goal, one can often obtain far better results than would be achieved by methodically replacing each step of a non-private computation with a differentially private implementation. Despite some astonishingly powerful computational results, there are still fundamental limitations — not just on what can be achieved with differential privacy but on what can be achieved with any method that protects against a complete breakdown in privacy. Virtually all the algorithms discussed herein maintain differential privacy against adversaries of arbitrary computational power. Certain algorithms are computationally intensive, others are efficient. Computational complexity for the adversary and the algorithm are both discussed.We then turn from fundamentals to applications other than queryrelease, discussing differentially private methods for mechanism design and machine learning. The vast majority of the literature on differentially private algorithms considers a single, static, database that is subject to many analyses. Differential privacy in other models, including distributed databases and computations on data streams is discussed.Finally, we note that this work is meant as a thorough introduction to the problems and techniques of differential privacy, but is not intended to be an exhaustive survey — there is by now a vast amount of work in differential privacy, and we can cover only a small portion of it.},

abstract = {Research on the anonymization of static data has made great progress in recent years. Generalization and suppression are two common technologies for quasi-identifiers’ anonymization. However, the characteristics of data streams, such as potential infinity and high dynamicity, make the anonymization of data streams different from the anonymization of static data. The methods for static data anonymization cannot be directly applied to anonymizing data streams. In this paper, a novel k-anonymization approach for data streams based on clustering is proposed. In order to speed up the anonymization process and reduce the information loss, the new approach scans a stream in one turn to recognize and reuse the clusters satisfying the k-anonymity principle. The time constraints on tuple publication and cluster reuse, which are specific to data streams, are considered as well. Furthermore, the approach is improved to conform to the ℓ-diversity principle. The experiments conducted on the real datasets show that the proposed methods are both efficient and effective.}

Several recent studies have explored various aspects of SGs to enhance power quality, as well as fault detection, localization, and classification. However, several factors still require further improvement. This review paper employs systematic review and bibliometric analysis to examine advanced SG technologies such as automatic voltage regulation (AVR), advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), automatic generation control (AGC), and wide area measurement systems (WAMS) before comparing their effectiveness at addressing operational problems such as voltage regulation as well as outage management and data processing. The study examines measurement tools such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), smart meters (SMs), digital measurement units (DMUs), and waveform measurement units (WMUs) to understand their roles in PQ events detection, classification, and location identification. Research trends and emerging technologies along with current research gaps were identified through a bibliometric study of peer-reviewed articles from Web of Science (2013–2024) using VOS Viewer visualization techniques. A combined analysis delivers an integrated view that shows how smart grid innovations and measurement solutions boost monitoring capabilities while simultaneously improving event analysis and grid resilience in contemporary power systems.}

Location privacy based on k-anonymity addresses this threat by cloaking the person's location such that there are at least k-1 other people within the cloaked area. We propose a distributed approach that integrates nicely with existing infrastructures for location-based services, as opposed to previous work. Our approach is based on homomorphic encryption and has several organizations, such as operators of cellphone networks, collaborate to let a user learn whether k-anonymity holds for her area without the organizations learning any additional information. We also outline several challenges that remain to be addressed.},

abstract = {The growth of big data can increase risks of re-identification in complex IoT environment. Data anonymization is widely used to prevent shared data from being re-identified private or sensitive information from anonymized data with other available data. It is very important to understand the risks of re-identification of results and process of commonly used anonymization techniques before properly mitigating. This work proposes a data anonymisation evaluation framework that can evaluate commonly used data anonymization algorithms in terms of privacy preserving level, data utility, and performance. Specifically, data utility, privacy metrics, and information loss were used to evaluate data anonymization schemes that can further optimise the data anonymization process to keep risks of re-identification low. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solution can effectively evaluate the performance and de-identification features that can help to prevent inappropriate usage of anonymized data.}

Demand response (DR), by promoting the interaction and responsiveness of the customers, may offer a broad range of potential benefits on system operation and expansion and on market efficiency. Moreover, by improving the reliability of the power system and, in the long term, lowering peak demand, DR reduces overall plant and capital cost investments and postpones the need for network upgrades. In this paper a survey of DR potentials and benefits in smart grids is presented. Innovative enabling technologies and systems, such as smart meters, energy controllers, communication systems, decisive to facilitate the coordination of efficiency and DR in a smart grid, are described and discussed with reference to real industrial case studies and research projects.}

The relatively low utilisation of generation and networks (of about 50%) means that there is significant scope for DSM to contribute to increasing the efficiency of the system investment. The importance of the diversity of electricity load is discussed and the negative effects of DSM on load diversity illustrated. Ageing assets, the growth in renewable and other low-carbon generation technologies and advances in information and communication technologies are identified as major additional drivers that could lead to wider applications of DSM in the medium term. Potential benefits of DSM are discussed in the context of generation and of transmission and distribution networks. The provision of back-up capacity by generation may not be efficient as it will be needed relatively infrequently, and DSM may be better placed to support security. We also present an analysis of the value of DSM in balancing generation and demand in a future UK electricity system with significant variable renewable generation. We give a number of reasons for the relatively slow uptake of DSM, particularly in the residential, commercial and small business sectors. They include a lack of metering, information and communication infrastructure, lack of understanding of the benefits of DSM, problems with the competitiveness of DSM when compared with traditional approaches, an increase in the complexity of system operation and inappropriate market incentives.}

abstract = {Utilities are currently deploying smart electricity meters in millions of households worldwide to collect fine-grained electricity consumption data. We present an approach to automatically analyzing this data to enable personalized and scalable energy efficiency programs for private households. In particular, we develop and evaluate a system that uses supervised machine learning techniques to automatically estimate specific “characteristics” of a household from its electricity consumption. The characteristics are related to a household's socio-economic status, its dwelling, or its appliance stock. We evaluate our approach by analyzing smart meter data collected from 4232 households in Ireland at a 30-min granularity over a period of 1.5 years. Our analysis shows that revealing characteristics from smart meter data is feasible, as our method achieves an accuracy of more than 70% over all households for many of the characteristics and even exceeds 80% for some of the characteristics. The findings are applicable to all smart metering systems without making changes to the measurement infrastructure. The inferred knowledge paves the way for targeted energy efficiency programs and other services that benefit from improved customer insights. On the basis of these promising results, the paper discusses the potential for utilities as well as policy and privacy implications.}

This paper presents a practical and efficient algorithm for determining a generalized version of data that masks sensitive information and remains useful for modelling classification. The generalization of data is implemented by specializing or detailing the level of information in a top-down manner until a minimum privacy requirement is violated. This top-down specialization is natural and efficient for handling both categorical and continuous attributes. Our approach exploits the fact that data usually contains redundant structures forclassification. While generalization may eliminate some structures, other structures emerge to help. Our results show that quality of classification can be preserved even for highly restrictive privacy requirements. This work has great applicability to both public and private sectors that share information for mutual benefits and productivity.},
